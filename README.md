# Competitive Programming in C++

This repository contains my solutions to problems from **Codeforces**, **LeetCode**, and other competitive programming platforms.  
The main goals of this repo are:
- Strengthening **C++ proficiency** through problem-solving
- Building strong **problem-solving and algorithmic skills**
- Tracking progress in **competitive programming**
- **Source files only** (`.cpp`) are tracked in Git.  
- **Compiled binaries** (`.exe`, `.out`) are ignored via `.gitignore`.
